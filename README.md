## Midterm Assignment - Light Through The Window

### This is a short game designed to allow the player to raise and take care of a plant until it blooms. The player is able to do different actions to care for the plant, like water it, turn it, or give it fertilizer.

### This is an example of a function written to decrease the plant's thirst, which increments happiness and advances the player towards beating the game.

### This function allows the player to purchase fertilizer from the store, while accounting for exceptions that could occur if the player tries to buy fertilizer when they already have it in their inventory. The function also stores purchased fertilizer in the player's inventory.

## Tip Calcuator

### This is a modified version of a calcuator application to print out a tip amount for the user we did in class. This excersise was my first time using switch cases, and also helped me understand how to make an argument when using a function.
